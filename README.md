From Space to Smoke is a Python-based data visualization project that explores Indonesia’s 2015 forest and peatland fires using NASA Terra satellite data.
It retrieves MODIS Fire Product (MOD14A1) datasets through the NASA LAADS DAAC API and visualizes detected hotspots across Indonesia to understand fire distribution and temporal patterns.
